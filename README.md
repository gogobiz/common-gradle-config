This is a repo for base gradle configurations to be inherited by multiple projects

Import them into your project like so:

apply from: 'runway/static-analysis.gradle'






This doesn't apply to me:

remote:   - how to build it
remote:   - how to test it
remote:   - what it interfaces with, dependencies, etc.
remote:   - where to get more info, apis etc.
